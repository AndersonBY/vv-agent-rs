# Run Budgets

`RunBudgetLimits` provides optional, task-neutral resource controls for one
Agent run. A budget limits resources; it does not inspect the prompt, decide
whether an answer is correct, or force a task-specific research phase.

## Public API

```rust
use vv_agent::{HostCost, RunBudgetLimits, RunConfig};

let limits = RunBudgetLimits::builder()
    .max_total_tokens(20_000)
    .max_uncached_input_tokens(12_000)
    .max_tool_calls(40)
    .max_tool_calls_by_name([("web_search", 12)])
    .max_wall_time_ms(300_000)
    .max_host_cost(HostCost::new("credits", 2_000_000)?)
    .build()?;

let result = runner
    .run_with_config(
        &agent,
        "Do the work",
        RunConfig::builder().budget_limits(limits).build(),
    )
    .await?;
```

All limits are optional. Omitted values mean unlimited, and an empty limits
object has no runtime effect. Wire integers are limited to
`0..9007199254740991`.

`result.budget_usage()` exposes the cumulative observation. A stop caused by a
budget has status `Failed`, completion reason `BudgetExhausted`, and a typed
`result.budget_exhaustion()`. Missing accounting stays missing; it is never
converted to zero.

## Enforcement

- Cancellation visible before admission wins over a budget stop.
- Token and host-cost readings are observed after an atomic model call, so one
  completed call may exceed its limit.
- Tool batches are checked and fully reserved before the first side effect. A
  rejected batch executes no tools.
- A tool or model operation error that already occurred is not replaced by a
  later budget observation.
- A natural terminal exactly at a limit remains valid. The next atomic
  operation is rejected because no capacity remains.
- `ContinueAndMark` records unavailable accounting and keeps running. `Stop`
  converts a configured unavailable dimension into a typed stop.

Configured runs emit `BudgetSnapshot` observations when accounting changes. A
budget stop emits exactly one `BudgetExhausted` event followed by the normal
`RunFailed` terminal. Runs without limits emit no budget events and preserve
the previous event order.

## Host Cost

`HostCostMeter::read()` returns a host-scoped cumulative reading. The SDK does
not contain a price table, convert currencies, or subtract an implicit
baseline. Unit, optional currency, and monotonicity must match the configured
limit exactly.

For distributed execution, register the meter in the worker-local capability
registry and set `RuntimeRecipe.capabilities.host_cost_meter_ref`.
Process-local meter objects are not serialized into job envelopes.

## Resume And Child Runs

Approval resume preserves the source run's usage while excluding approval wait
time. The resumed model loop still receives the normal fresh `max_cycles`
allowance. Independent Runner calls start fresh.

Framework-created child runs inherit limits but use fresh token, tool, cycle,
and elapsed counters. A parent host meter is not propagated implicitly. Share a
host-scoped meter explicitly when parent and child work must consume one global
ledger.

Distributed workers persist `budget_usage` in the current checkpoint and add
only each active monotonic worker segment. Queue time is excluded. Checkpoint
state does not claim exactly-once behavior for external effects.

## Verification

```bash
cargo test -p vv-agent --test run_budget
cargo test -p vv-agent --test distributed_checkpoint --test checkpoint_core
cargo test -p vv-agent --test app_server_contract_parity
```

The normative cross-language behavior is pinned by `contract.lock.json` and
the vendored `run_budget.json` and `budget_events.jsonl` fixtures.
